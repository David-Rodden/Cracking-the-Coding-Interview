:book:Cracking the Coding Interview :computer:
========================================
*Cracking the Coding Interview* is a book written by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
It gives a wide range of computer science-related problems to solve, dealing mostly in the realm of data structures and algorithms.

Here, you will find my solutions to these problems as I work through them.

There are three criteria I will follow when approaching a problem:

- Reading the question carefully as to not miss any crucial information.
- Working within the problem's given constraints.
- Implementing a solution in a clear manner, applying proper variable names and adding comments where deemed necessary.
- Implementing a solution with an ideal or reasonable time complexity.
- Showcasing the class/method's usage within the chapter's __TestingGrounds__.

I own the 6th edition, which can be found [here](http://a.co/d/4f8cHFy).
